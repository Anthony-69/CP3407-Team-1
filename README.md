It includes:

 - A brief guideline detailing possible actions users can take on the different pages throughout the application.

Any details and experiences on the process of this project can be found in the report.

*Important Note:* Given that development was done and housed through Figma and Bravo Studio, as opposed to Github directly, commits and version history will not show here on Github. Instead, **refer to the version history in the Figma board** using the link above. This can be found by selecting the button at the very top left, and under "File" selecting **"Show Version History"**
